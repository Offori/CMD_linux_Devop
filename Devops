In AWS there are many layers where you can add security
In AWS security is share responsability (SG, NACL + API, )

gate way - service to create, monitor, publish, maintain and secure API and it's created by default
public subnet - Free region
Private subnet - space to create an application, ..., Don't have access to internet
load balancer - add one or more back/front end (e.g: ec2, private/public IP address, ...), can have access to IP address and provide info to subnet
route table - set of rules to determine where info from gateway/load balancer should go(Network trafic) and created by default
security groups - for security purpose
NACL(or ACLs) - define by default by default for any VM (Network access control list) used at the EC2 level
RLB - 
NAT gateway- mask the IP address of an app i ec2 
SNAT - 
VPC - 
VPC - flow role
T + P <- Security Group + NACL[Access]
In S G <- (inbound, outbound), 
And in SG we can have only while in NACL we have allow and deny
When an actor creates a PVC AWS creates an internet gate way, a NACL, and a route table additionaly u can create an ec2 instance and atouch the SG to it then we will play a configuration with NACL ane SG and see ho the route trafics goes through the application in ec2 like wht will happen if I block something in NACL and Allow it in SG, ...
python3 to check if python is installed and go on its editer
CTRL + D <- quit python3 editer
EC2 provides compute as a service
Bostian host(or instance) rhe madiator between the private subnet and public subnet
path_of_key_pair/test.pem path_of_key_pair/test.pem ubuntu@public IP address:/home/ubuntu - to copy the key value pair to from my personal laptop to the ubuntu ec2 aws instance which mostly is the bostion instance
ssh -i keypair copied from personal laptop to the bostion ubuntu@public_IP_address (NB: before lunching first check of ur on the right path where the keypair is install)
if you lunch it and u get the warning message unpprotected private key file and says the 0664 ur_key_pair is too open then change the mode by typping in the terminal/.. chmod 600

ROUTE 53
Route 53 provides DNS as a service
DNS <- Domain Name System and it resolve ur domain name to the load balancer or into IP Address
Domain registration
whenever you purchased and hosted your domain outside AWS you have to create a hosted zone in route 53 of aws 
health check - chaeck the activity of the web server
