ls list
ls -ltr list with the time stamp
man the manual (e.g man touch)
vi notepad
vim notepad but need to install it
#!/bin/bash
executable bash sh ksh dash
#!/ named shebang
cat print the content of the file
./ or sh execute an executable (need to grant permission)
chmod grant permission to a file (what permission for the admin, which group, what are your permission) 
      permission is grant via numbers(e.g chmod 777 nameofthefile [you just grant all the permission])

in organization most of the time we use linux with shell scripting to maintain the infratructur, code structur and the configuration management as a devop ingeneer

shell scripting
  one of the key idea of writing a shell scripting is monitoring your task (CPU going off, momry too slow, load helth, ...)
nproc list the cpu on your machine
free knowing the memories on your machine
top the top process that are running on ur machine
df available storage space
set -x debug mode
ps -ef entire process as a full format
      grep to filter process (e.g: ps -ef | grep "amazon")
pipe (|) send the output of the first command to the next one

why is date | echo "this" print this only? because date is default system command taht send info to stdin but pipe will never get the info from stdin
wget to download the content as a file (need cat name of the file | grep ERROR)
sudo find -name pam finad all the file with name pam into the intire system 

signals ctrl is one of the signal
trap 
awk process scanning (to retreive the column info e.g: ps -ef | grep amazon awk F" " '{print $2}')
set -e exit the script when there is an error
set -o 
if an app is failing go tothe log file to find the error
curl retreive resourse from internet
